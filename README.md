# toolSegmentation
This repository is built on a fork of project **robot-surgery-segmentation** (at https://github.com/ternaus/robot-surgery-segmentation), the official implementation of the paper *Automatic Instrument Segmentation in Robot-Assisted Surgery using Deep Learning*. Shvets, Alexey A., et al. IEEE Int. Conf. on Machine Learning and Applications. 2018.

The main goal is to obtain a tool segmentation model adapted to the requirements of the project **EndoMapper**.
